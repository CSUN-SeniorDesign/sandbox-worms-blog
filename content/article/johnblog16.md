Upon the start of this semester, we discussed our plans before going forward and also took into account other items detailed in advancing tech documents from last semester. We also deliberated on how groups and tasks should be broken up for this semester and came to the consensus that smaller groups would be do.
After reviewing documentation, we took note of other items needed for inventory and other items we believe we may or may not be able to implement.
There will be further discussion on future actions this semester.
