This was the first week after we formed the new teams for the rest of our senior design project. Earlier we discussed with our group which project we would like to work on, and thankfully we ended up in the same team for TechLab, moreover we had three more people from the other group joining us. I was absent on Monday, so I missed introduction part of the project. During the week I met all new members of the group, signed up for GitLab which I missed on Monday. Looks like our work for TechLab now will be tracked on GitLab.
Our team divided on sub teams, our old team decided to work on DNS and DHCP while another sub team picked Firewall and Router. I was assigned to work on DHCP with John. From my teammates I received the username and password to be able ssh to techlab then both Firewalls A and B. As I successfully ssh-ed to TechLab and Firewalls I started off from looking for all dhcp related files.
I found some configuration files like dhcpd.conf and dhclient.conf, to get more understanding what they do I looked up for dhcp configuration samples with detailed description. Also I refreshed my knowledge about dhcp by watching video sourced at www.lynda.com, that I have been using along this semester.
