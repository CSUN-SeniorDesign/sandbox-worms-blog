# AWS Cost and Presentations #

----------

4 projects in 8 hectic weeks was a good experience. We learned so much about AWS and many concepts. In this week, we focused more on the business side of IT. We started digging into the cost of AWS. Calculating the cost for different AWS services is very intimidating at first. 

For example, Amazon gives so many fields to fill to accurately calculate the costs of S3. We went one field at a time. We tried to understand what each field is about. In the end, it provides a clearer picture of what the cost is. At first, we thought it will be expensive to have like 390,000 requests in a month. It turns out, that is only a few cents. The numbers look big but it doesn't mean it costs much. This project exercise is very useful. It allows us to be more comfortable in pricing AWS. 

The quantity of presentations for our long term projects is not as expected. However, there are still some interesting projects. 2 that caught my attention are the legal form and the advancing tech lab. The most interesting thing about the legal form is the specificity of the project request. It feels to have a really high chance of success. It gives us an opportunity to work on a project for a business. In contrast, the most interesting thing about the advancing tech lab is the vagueness of the project. After the LDAP and firewall requirements, the students are free to propose what they want to do with the hardware. This sounds very interesting. Tough choices ahead..!!
