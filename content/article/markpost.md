     I have found this first week very challenging, almost overwhelming.  I was completely new to Git, AWS, and most of the other utilities associated with AWS.  Git was easy to install and start using but it took a little while to understand how to deal with retreaving a file, making changes and local storage and storage in the repository. I was introduced to Chocolatey.  It was nice to find out that even Windows has a software repository that is similar to linux version of say, yum, even if it is a pay for site.  Choclatey was needed so we could download Hugo. Hugo is a static website generator that we use to generate our blog post. 
     I am very happy with my group members.  They all are helpful.  We have organized how to seperate out the peices of work for AWS, VPC, EC2 and Route53. 
	I began by working ahead with EC2 and setting up an instance of Amazon Linux AMI with PHP and MySQL.  I did this out of order and now have to go back and do the basics.
