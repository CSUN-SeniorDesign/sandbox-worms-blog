It's been a bit of a somber past couple of weeks. A good friend of mine from high school passed away the Sunday after Thanksgiving. Needless to say, it hasn't been easy to get back into the swing of things academically. I didn't think it would be this hard to get back into the schooling mindset. I came to class on Tuesday to meet with my group, let them know I was going to miss the presentation on Thursday because the funeral was scheduled for 2:00pm that afternoon in Fullerton. With an 11am presentation, even if we were the first group to present, I'd be cutting it extremely tight especially due to the traffic, plus I really wasn't in the mood to present that day. I was able to talk to a couple of my group members on Tuesday when I went to class, but it seemed like we were basically on the same page as to how were going about the project. Setting up our own similar environments, trying to manipulate the systems a bit like how they're set up now, and try to document as much of the information as possible throughout the process. 

I'll continue to push forward with the research and documentation needed for each of the tasks listed by Professor Wiegley. After talking to Neel, it sounds like Professor Wiegley has made a lot of changes to the system and a lot of it is hard coded which only adds to the level of difficulty when it comes to documentation. I also understand there's a separate group of students, possibly graduates, that are working on one of the servers for monetary compensation so they're implementing changes which can throw us off also. With having back to back short weeks it made it hard for us to get together as a group. Plus, with the loss of my friend, it made it even harder for me to meet. We haven't been able to make much progress, as much as we'd like at least, but hopefully we can start making some serious moves in a positive direction soon. 

Overall, it seems as though everyone in our group is under the same mindset of finishing these last two weeks of the semester STRONG!
