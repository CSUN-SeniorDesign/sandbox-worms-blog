After we have been divided into teams, our team decided to determine each group member’s strengths and experience level to assign tasks more efficiently. After the tasks were assigned, every team member had to complete the individual part which included setting up accounts for both GitHub and AWS, installing Hugo and posting the first blog post on the repo.
Since I have never had any experience with Git it was quite an interesting experience. GitHub is a popular online platform that allows people around the world work on the projects together while also providing some great features that helps to assign tasks and see each member’s contribution in the project. Facing with Amazon Web Services (AWS) was also new to me. Creating AWS account was as easy as signing up new Gmail account. AWS will be used to create the professional and public environment for the future projects. As for this week we had to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which is one of the AWS services, with a given subnet which had to be divided 3 public and 3 private subnets with specific number of IP addresses per subnet. In addition, route table were configured for both public and private subnets. Thanks to AWS it can be done manually. In order to run Hugo, the “markdown” language that helps easily interpret and build content into a website, I had to install homebrew first. It is an open source software package management system that helps to install software on macOS.
On the final steps of publishing this post entry I have hard time trying to push the .md file to the repo because of the authentication error (which didn’t make any sense). I was offered to try Personal Access Tokens instead of the password since I was using two-factor authorization and it finally worked. There is also another way of connecting to Git, via SSH.
