I was able to get both the desktop and server versions of Ubuntu 16.04 installed on separate virtual machines on my laptop using Virtual Box. My teammates let me know that I need the newest version of Ubuntu, version 18, so I'll probably work on installing that over the weekend and possibly playing around a little bit within the environment. I'll setup DNS first, since I'm familiar with how to go about doing that, then I'll work on setting up DHCP and configuring the firewall. I also plan on working on setting up my VPN to get access remotely to the Advancing Tech machines. 

The exposure to setting up DNS on the Linux VM was beneficial to me because I set it up first hand, by myself, and even got a little more familiar with Linux - especially since it's CLI based and installed with minimal presets I had to familiarize myself with more Linux commands. Also, the fact that access to Firewall A and the network behind the firewall were both restricted, I was forced to shell into Firewall B and navigate around through there - like having to SSH into either of the other two machines or connecting via FTP in case there was any need to transfer files. 

Overall, it's been a good transition from the extremely fast paced first eight weeks we had in this class. It's nice to have a bigger team to split up more the tasks with also since there's tons of stuff to get done on the list that Professor Wiegley gave us.
