Picked up where we left off last week except this time, using containers to automate the entire process. Started off by watching some www.lynda.com videos regarding Docker - what it is, how it works, how it's used, what are the benefits. As we got together as a group during the week, I was assigned with the task of assisting our group leader, John, on configuring the required Terraform and ECS material. As we're working on the prooject, I come to learn that everything has already been written and configured according to project guidelines so I was then asked to direct my attention to Docker. The next step is to pick up where I left off with Docker, do some review, try and get Docker installed and get a webserver setup on there at least, then try and get more familiar with it as much as possible so I can hopefully produce some useful info for our team. Looking forward to the next project since it'll be my turn to step up and bat as team-lead. If we do end up going the route of collaborating with the Comp 491 class in the latter half of this semester going into next semester, then the next project will be very interesting to say the least.
