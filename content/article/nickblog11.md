	We're now starting to form into groups relative to what we'll be working on as our Senior Design Project throughout the rest of this course, up until next May. I'm glad most of us were able to stick together, but sad to see one of our colleagues depart. Nonetheless, I'm looking forward to working with a new group of guys on the Advancing Tech project. I felt a bit overwhelmed upon receipt of the initial project description and guidelines, but knew that the work wouldn't seem that bad once the tasks were broken down. Luckily, for the first two task were trying to tackle - DHCP/DNS and Firewall - we have two individuals within our newly formed groups that have prior experience with both. I'm coming into this project with a little bit of knowledge and experience dealing with both DHCP and DNS. I'm familiar with some of the terminology and functionalities, just haven't really set one up myself. 

	As part of this first leg of the project, I've been tasked with getting an Ubuntu Server spun up via VM and setting up DNS. This should give me an insight of how things work, what we should be looking for, and a better understanding of the functionality of the system. After we gather some information, our group plans on getting together to discuss the findings and analyzing the data. Unfortunately, I wasn't here the day when our group took a trip to the building where all of the equipment is, but I'm hoping we're able to take a trip within the next week to take a better look at the hardware.
