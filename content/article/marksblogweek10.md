Marks Blog Week 10								November 2, 2018

This week our group worked on Project 5.  The main idea was to take our plan from week 4 and make it happen.  With cost cutting being the main idea and the largest portion of the cost being incurred with running instances we cut all instances.  The web pages are hosted in a S3 bucket. I did not have much experience with Terraform so I wanted to focus on this topic for this week.  I mostly hard coded the entries like
    domain_name = "dt45fde2scz1z.cloudfront.net"
    origin_id   = "S3-sandboxworms-proj5-102018"
Our big improvement was trying setting up cloudfront which should speed up access to our website.  This is still not working.
This week we chose our projects that we want to work on.  I chose Advancing Tech.  This is exciting and I am hoping to get on a team that works on integration with camus LDAP.
