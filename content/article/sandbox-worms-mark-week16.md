Marks Blog Week 16					January 25, 2019

Well seems that we are off to a rocky start.  After discovering the AdvancingTechProjects.pdf file this week our project became much clearer.  We did a lot of good work last semester but it was not coordinated very well.  Some of the work was duplicated.  Not a big deal but the 2 groups need to be restructured and work together as a team.  
First we need to divide the group up so that each person gets involved in the work.
Second the work needs to be divided up so that everyone has something to do.

One of the first things that needs to happen is a group needs to be set to work on the server deployment in the MDF.   A new motherboard has been given to me by Dr. Wiegley.   This motherboard needs to be replaced due to an ethernet port that was not working on one of the servers that Dr Wiegley provided.

Then a OS need to be installed.  We chose…. Install Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS.
The Lilo ports needs to be set up.

A second major goal is network mapping/discovery/documenting.

A third goal is metric collecting.  This may be done using Prometheus.

Monday should see Lisa approving the group divisions.  Then we can get started.

It should be noted that our certificate on our website is expired and https is not working…. We will get that fixed soon.
