This we week, we had finally gotten our hands on the new hp servers and were able to test out installing ubuntu and test out different RAID configurations. We also looked into the ILO interface and figured out that security credentials are marked on the case while figuring out how RAID configuration was accessed; in doing so, we also played with certain DIP switches and navigated the marked documentation.  
Future plans include testing out the different interfaces to test network functionality before running the final configuration and bringing it to the rack. We also discussed our plans for next semester what needed to be done before implementing the other items listed in the documentation.
