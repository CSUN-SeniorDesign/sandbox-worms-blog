Initially, I was assigned to work on AIM part, creating user for CircleCi with policies and roles. Since it was among one of the things that had to be done first to set up the environment, it had to be done as soon as possible. This time we had backup person (who was responsible for this part in previous project) for each issue of the project, who would assist with tasks if needed. I found some sample code for creating user and created policy with least privileges, and then my teammate showed how to attach the policy and finished the rest of the work.
After assigned part was completed, I jumped on DataDog while my teammates were completing configuring the environment. I have sign up and sent invitations for my teammates, then followed the command lines for ansible (we decide to stick with it after last project) provided at their source site. After downloading datadog agent on the host, some command lines should be added to the playbook, which will integrate instances with datadog. Datadog dashboard is pretty straight forward and could be managed from the website by choosing the required metrics.
