Luckily this week, Professor Wiegley was able to drop off the new HP servers with Mark which was great because we were able to play around a bit, initially by installing Ubuntu and testing out different RAID configs. We did a little research on ILO interface, learned about security credentials, and found out how RAID configuration is accessed. We also messed around with DIP switches and navigated the marked documentation. 

Members of our group were able to come up with a design of the physical hardware that's currently in the MDF. Neel was able to see the other machines that might be on the racks, Mark was able to confirm and make adjustments accordingly to the schematics, and John was able to render up a final design of what the two racks containing the servers we're working on looks like currently.

Moving forward we plan on testing different interfaces to gauge network functionality before running the final configuration and taking it to the MDF. We also discussed future plans for next semester regarding what needs to be done before implementing the other items listed in the documentation. With finals week coming up, I've come down with a slight case of the flu which hasn't been too bad, but stressing over finals while being sick is not fun.
