Since we weren't able to get our Terraform codes to run properly on the past project, a couple of us took upon the task of trying to give it a go once again. Since this model isn't as intricate as any of the ones from our past projects - fairly simple, doesn't require too much code - we were asked to try and get everything running properly. I tried my best, but kept running into problems within my own environment - something about "duplicate configurations" - so I uploaded my code to GitHub in hopes that someone would be able to point me on the right direction.

Aside from working on project 5 this week, we also chose the projects we'd like to work on moving forward going into next semester. For me, I was assigned to Professor Wiegley's "Advancing Tech" project along with several other of my current group members so the new change won't be too bad. We created an Advancing Tech channel in Slack, but need to invite several other group members. From my understanding, we're going to be learning about the systems, configurations, settings, and components that have to do with the project starting next Monday so definitely looking forward to that. After speaking with some classmates, it seems like LDAP is the key component people are interested in learning about.

On a side note, today's presentation caught me off guard so it's easy to say that I was not at all prepared for it. I sort of "winged-it" so hopefully I didn't look too bad, but man, that was a nasty curve ball. I was honestly expecting to sit with my group members and try to solve the issue I was having with my Terraform code. Since I have a midterm tomorrow, I decided to upload my code to GitHub in hopes that someone can pull my code and test it in their environment and hopefully make the necessary changes to have it run properly. 

As for the websites I used, I've posted them in past blogs so I figured there's no point of listing them here. However, I have to say I found the Terraform guides on Hashicorp's website were extremely helpful.
