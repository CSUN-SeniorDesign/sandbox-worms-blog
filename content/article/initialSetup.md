Throughout this first week of CIT480, I've been exposed to some new applications and software like Hugo and Git.

I have a bit of experience with GitHub, but not having Git installed on my local machine. It's been quite an

interesting process, sort of similar to Linux commands, but definitely new to me. I've also had the pleasure of 

installing Chocolatey to be able to install Hugo on my Windows PC. I've contemplated possibly transitioning to a 

Linux box, but didn't commit to the change. Git Bash is a new shell script I'm dealing with, but seems pretty similar

to Linux terminal. We have our VPC setup along with our subnets, so in the next week, our team will focus on getting

things functionally working via our webserver.
